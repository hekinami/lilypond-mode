Just a copy of elisp directory of (lilypond)[https://github.com/lilypond/lilypond] source, for using with [quelpa](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa), because we don't need the whole lilypond source code in such case.

This may not be needed any more if quelpa can handle this (issue)[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa/issues/164]
